# node-development
 
Hello devs, in this repository I will create some tests to improve my knowledge of Node.js and some frameworks. I will be using the Prisma ORM to manage my database, to facilitate development. In each file, I will try to leave a README showing what was done in the file.

## ðŸ“¦Install

If you want to test any file for learning purposes, you can edit the .env.example file that I will leave in all folders, and there you can edit the DATABASE_URL with your connection string to your database.

after having cloned this repository type the following command inside the selected folder:

```bash
 yarn install or npm install
```

In this project, PostgreSQL is being used. If you want to change the database Prisma will connect to, access the schema.prisma file and make the changes according to your database. Here is the link to the prisma website in case you are having difficulties https://www.prisma.io/
